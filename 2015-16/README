These are the disaggregated data files for 2015-16. Each text file includes the header appropriate to the data year, since file formats changed over time. The NC.txt file contains all file lines beginning with "NC-". The individual LEA files contain all file lines beginning with three numerical characters. The charters.txt file contains all other file lines, which for this year all begin as NNA, that is, two digits and an alpha character.
