These are the disaggregated data files for 2018-19 in the release dated in October 2019. There was an earlier release by NCDPI but those files were preliminary and are replaced by these. Each text file includes the header appropriate to the data year, since file formats changed over time. The NC.txt file contains all file lines beginning with "NC-". The individual LEA files contain all file lines beginning with three numerical characters. The charters.txt file contains all other file lines, which for this year all begin as NNA, that is, two digits and an alpha character.
